        <p>As a healthcare industry professional with over 10 years of experience, my goal is to leverage medical economics and data analytics against quality of care in order to influence the best possible decision for better healthcare outcomes.
            I am passionate about developing an understanding of a population’s health through healthcare claims data. I provide population health analysis through the validation and compilation of healthcare claims for internal and external stakeholders. I am experienced in presenting data and findings in a narrative format that is easy to understand and digest. I combine my formal training in journalism with my hands-on learning of healthcare systems and claims data in order to tell a simple story of the current state of a population’s health.</p>
